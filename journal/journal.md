# SDC Engineering Journal and Notes

Brenton Hershner

## API Specifications
### Which api did you choose? Why?

- Product. We decided on Group 3â€™s FEC app before selecting our apiâ€™s. Tony did the Product Detail Module for Group 3 so he couldnâ€™t do the Product api. Gabe was interested in Q&A over 

### What will you have to do to recreate this api? 

- Implement a relational database to access and deliver the data.

### Find ways to scale the deployment and make the api as performant as possible. 

### What is itâ€™s main functionality or purpose?

- Deliver the results of a query to the product endpoint

### What are important design/styles to create for the user experience?

- Very fast and efficient code. Scalable infrastructure.

- Setup a Trello board for the group.
- Selected a set of technologies to be implemented in the SDC sprint.
- Defined a database schema for the product api.

What went well?  What could be improved?
  - Good first day with the new group. We setup a lot of sytems. We were unclear on some of the requirements. We could have asked clarifying questions sooner.

What went badly?  What have you tried? What is next step?
  - The Google form link didnâ€™t work for many. Someone asked for help but it didnâ€™t seem too important so the answer was deferred until tomorrow morning.

- Fought quite a bit with the installation of postgress. Josh suggested that I might have installed it correctly in the beginning but just had permission issues with logging into a specific database. He added that you need to create a new user account and assign it specific permissions in order to interact with the database.

## Daily Reflections 2021-05-05 W8D3

- Spent a lot of time trying to determine how to best parse the csv data and save it back as a cleaned file.
- Csv-parse and csv-parser are ***NOT*** the same.
- Parsing a csv with mismatched quotes needs to be done by ignoring the quote character. `parse({quote:false})` and then replace all the quotes by using a regular expression since node doesn't allow for replaceAll (strangely).

## Daily Reflections 2021-05-06 W8D4

- Before effective cleaning functions could be written, the problems in the data first had to understood. The cleaning funciton for each table was written to generate an object which reported information about the records. For example how many records had 3 fields and how many had 4. For fields that appeared to be numbers, what was the total number of records that were able to be converted into a number and did that match the total number of records. For records with only a few possibilities, like sizes ranging from XXS to XXL and 5 to 14 incrementing by 0.5, were there any skus that didn't fit this format? I also added a line to console log every 100,000 records so that I knew it was still running and not to interupt it.

Here is an examle of the output of this function after the data has been cleaned:

- To start up the postgres server:
    `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start`

- Navigating within psql:
  ```

- When creating tables, use commas but **not** after the last statement. Also, don't forget your semicolons.
- In Postgres, use `TEXT` instead of `VARCHAR(n)` for unlimited length.
- **Be careful about syntax differences with mySQL!!!**
  - UNSIGNED and TINYINT are not a valid data types in postgres. Use INTEGER instead of INT.

- Spent some time down a rabbit hole of how to make a better markdown engineering journal. Installed a VS Code extension called [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image) to allow me to drop screenshots right in with a shortcut (âŒ˜âŒ¥v)
- Added notes in the form of [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/index.html) to the routes for the product api calls.
- Modifying the project structure a bit to follow this example on the node-postgres documentation page. [Suggested Project Structure](https://node-postgres.com/guides/project-structure)

- A VERY simple query took 0.422 ms. Off to a good start, but I'm sure it will only get more time consuming as I start joining tables...

## Daily Reflections 2021-05-10 W9D1

- Spent some time testing different ways to organize the code and function calls. I'm trying to make sure it's clean and each function ends up where it makes the most sense.

- Following the pg guide with async await queries, the first query is in the bag. What's the catch? This seems too easy. I must be missing something. Boiling it all down, this is the query definition: 

```const query = async (text, params) => pool.query(text, params);```

  ...and here is the code for the Product Information query:

![](./images/2021-05-10-15-58-06.png)

| Product_id | Response time |
| --- | --- |
| 50 | 111 ms |
| 500000 | 109 ms |
| 990000 | 116 ms |

- Most of my time today has been fighting to understand how to use and the differences between array_to_json, array_agg, row_to_json functions in postgresql queries.

## Daily Reflections 2021-05-11 W9D2

Pete shared with me a really great article about how to return JSON objects from PostgreSQL queries. It really helped! Thanks Pete!!!

[Query Nested Data in Postgres using Node.js](https://itnext.io/query-nested-data-in-postgres-using-node-js-35e985368ea4)

Finally getting somewhere with my style query.

![](./images/2021-05-11-16-20-18.png)

![](./images/2021-05-11-16-20-53.png)

Response time for this query midway in the data uncached and without indexing is 200 ms.

Alright. Now I've incorporated the photos but query times have gone way up. 2.5 seconds. ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜¬

![](./images/2021-05-11-17-39-05.png)

Had to use json_object_agg and json_build_object in order to finally get the query shape correct. Query time is 3.5 seconds without optimization or indexing.

![](./images/2021-05-11-18-06-10.png)

Seems really slow but I didn't think the product info was very slow. Product info is doing two queries and didn't see so relatively slow. I'm going to revisit the product info...

ProductInfo  with a query to get most of the product info and then another query to fetch the features. Now I know enough that I can rewrite this to be returned in a single query.

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-35-07.png)

After some testing, it seems the difference is neglidgeable but actually faster to do 2 separate queries... Not what I expected but at least I'm getting better at nested queries!

product_id:3
| # of queries | Response time |
| --- | --- |
| 2 queries | 80 ms |
| 1 query | 84 ms |

#### So close, but still no cigar...

The query for related products is close... The query (below) is generating an object with "array_agg" as the key and the result I want as the value. I can't figure out how to just return the value out of this object by using SQL. Sure, it would be trivially easy to pull it out using javascript, but I didn't sign up for Hack Reactor to take the easy way out!!!

![](./images/2021-05-12-00-15-56.png)

This is the query and it's result:

![](./images/2021-05-12-00-16-42.png)

List Products is similar. It's pretty much done. The pagination even works, but I can't figure out how to pull the value out of the object via SQL.. The following is the query and result.

![](./images/2021-05-12-00-19-26.png)

![](./images/2021-05-12-00-23-24.png)

## Daily Reflections 2021-05-12 W9D3

I give up trying to return just an array. I've tried about 10 different ways but can't figure it out.

Starting to test:

|  | Product | Styles | Related |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rows | 997483 | 1958101 | 1136021 |
| last product_id | 1000011 | 1000011 | 296448 |


| Description      | k6 avg pre-index | k6 avg w/indexing |
| ---------------- | ------ | --- |
| List Products    | 213 ms  | 289 ms |
| Product Info     | 283 ms | 297 ms |
| Product Styles   | 4.74 s | 4.22 s |
| Related Products | 159 ms | 204 ms |

### k6 testing locally

    brew  install k6

Following k6's documentation:

![](./images/2021-05-12-15-28-43.png)

resulted in this, very poor performance...

![](./images/2021-05-12-15-29-46.png)

I believe I figured out why I couldn't return just an array but an object with the array I want as a value of that object... I believe it has to do with the rowMode option within node-postgres (pg). A description of it is in the [documentation](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries).

![](./images/2021-05-13-10-28-32.png)

### Summary of query speed problem

All queries are about 1000 times slower when using the server when compared to running in the postgres terminal.

Here is the all in one query for styles:

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-23-28.png)

This is the schema and how it's indexed:

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-44-49.png)!

This is how the database is being connected to:

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-37-46.png)

This is the database config file. I've tried increaseing the number of clients for the pool and increasing the idle and connection timeouts to no effect:

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-39-02.png)

This is how I've setup my server. I've also tried to write my queries directly in this file to avoid routing altogether to no avail...:

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-40-26.png)

I'm load testing by hitting a random style within +/- 2.5 percentile from three points in the database (5th percentile, 50th percentile, and 95th percentile).

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-47-14.png)

Here is the result in k6:

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-49-29.png)

And here are the console logs from the morgan middleware, which I've tried to disable to see if that was the problem. Narrator: "It was not":

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-49-19.png)

At someone's suggestion, I tried postman too to see if it was any different. Same.

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-54-09.png)

This problem does seem to be caused by the server because the query when copied and pasted into the postgres terminal, it returns results in ***one-thousanth*** of the time **(4.160 ms)**.

![](./images/2021-05-13-09-57-06.png)

For other problems, this site might be helpful for determining why some queries take longer than others. [explain.depesz.com](https://explain.depesz.com/)

Things I've tried to speed up the queries.
- Indexing on all primary keys and any place where a column is used to filter.
- Removing the 'express-promise-router'
- Eliminating routes altogether and just writing the query directly in the server.
- Simplifying the query to the very basics. Even a simple `SELECT * FROM product WHERE product_id = 1` takes 35 ms. How in the WORLD are we supoosed to get a complex query with subqueries or joins under 10 ms?!?!?!
  - Unless... Maybe it's not the query or database afterall... When running a query with EXPLAIN ANALYZE before the query string, the same query reportedly took 0.053 ms to plan and 0.030 ms to execute... It's similar when running that simple query in the postgres terminal. Something weird might be going on with the pg pool... Or we are just measuring the wrong thing (i.e. the 50 ms requirement might be the query and not the time expected for the database to return results...)

My plan is to just deploy what I have and book office hours to try to figure out why it's so slow and what I can do to speed the queries up...

AWS account created. Spun up an EC2 instance but the key downloaded was a .cer file and not a .pem file. I might have missed an option somewhere. There are scripts people have dropped in stack overflow to convert .cer files into .pem files but the two I tried didn't work. Hopefully I didn't just install a bitcoin miner on my local machine... ðŸ˜¬ It's now 11:30pm. ðŸ˜´ I'm going to start over in the morning.

## Daily Reflections 2021-05-13 W9D4

.cer vs .pem file - Turns out it seems like [either is ok.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23225112/amazon-aws-ec2-getting-a-cer-file-instead-of-pem/23595139)

Need load balances for each server endpoint. Need a load balancer to direct to different clients too.

loader.io for deployed testing

And I think I randomly found what I was looking for to just return the value and not an object with a key value pair. This is from the [pg documentaiton](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries)
